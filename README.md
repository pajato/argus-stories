# argus-stories
A compendium of Agile stories for the Argus project without a clear home project.

Given that Argus is an agile, disributed, [libre software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) project, i.e. there is no central office for people working on Argus with an Agile board containing stories written on stickies or cards, the stories will be "displayed" using Github Issues using this repo.
